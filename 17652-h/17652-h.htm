<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>Introduction.</h2>


<p>The popular story of Whittington and his Cat is one in which a version
of a wide-spread folk-tale has been grafted upon the history of the life
of an historical character, and in the later versions the historical
incidents have been more and more eliminated. The three chief points in
the chap-book story are, 1, the poor parentage of the hero; 2, his
change of mind at Highgate Hill by reason of hearing Bow Bells; and, 3,
his good fortune arising from the sale of his cat. Now these are all
equally untrue as referring to the historical Whittington, and the
second is apparently an invention of the eighteenth century. When the
Rev. Canon Lysons wrote his interesting and valuable work entitled <i>The
Model Merchant</i> he showed the incorrectness of the first point by
tracing out Whittington's distinguished pedigree, but he was loath to
dispute the other two. It is rather strange that neither Mr. Lysons nor
Messrs. Besant and Rice appear to have seen the work which I now present
to my readers, which is the earliest form of the life of Whittington
known to exist. This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> printed from the copy in the Pepysian Library,
a later edition of which, with a few typographical alterations, will be
found in the British Museum library. This <i>History</i> will be found to
differ very considerably from the later and better-known story, which
appears to have been written early in the eighteenth century. A
comparison between the latter which I print at the end of this Preface
(p. xxix.) with T. H.'s earlier text will not, I think, be found
unprofitable. <i>The Famous and Remarkable History</i> here reprinted is
undated, but was probably published about 1670; the later edition in the
British Museum is dated 1678. One passage on page 7&mdash;"The merchant went
then to the Exchange, which was then in Lumber-street, about his
affairs"&mdash;seems to show that it was originally written quite early in
the century, and it is just possible that T. H. stands for the
voluminous playwright and pamphleteer Thomas Heywood. The Exchange was
removed to its present site in 1568, and therefore our tract could not
have been written before that date, but must have appeared when the
memory of the old meeting-place was still fresh in public memory. On
page 11 it will be seen that Whittington, when discontented with his
position in Fitzwarren's house, set out before day-break on All
Hallows-day with his clothes in a bundle, in order to seek his fortune
elsewhere. He had only got as far as Bunhill when he heard Bow bells
ring out what appeared to be&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>

<p>These words took complete possession of him, and he returned before it
was known that he had run away. In the more modern chap-book Whittington
is made to reach Holloway, where it would be less easy to hear Bow
bells, and from which place he would have found it more difficult to
return before the cook had risen. As far as I can find there is no
allusion to Holloway or Highgate hill in any early version, and it is
evident that this localization is quite modern. Mr. Lysons is certainly
wrong when he says that at Highgate "a stone continued to mark the spot
for many centuries." It is not known when the stone was first erected
there, but it was probably put up when the name of the place was first
foisted into the tale. One stone was taken away in 1795, but others have
succeeded it, and now there is a Whittington Stone Tavern; and the
situation of Whittington College, which was removed to Highgate in 1808,
has helped to favour the supposition that Whittington himself was in
some way connected with that place.</p>

<p>The form of invitation which the bells rung out varies very much in the
different versions.</p>

<p>In Richard Johnson's ballad (1612) we find&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Whittington, back return."</span><br />
</p>

<p>which is then amplified into&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Turn againe, Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For thou in time shall grow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord Maior of London."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>In T. H.'s <i>History</i> (see p. 11) we have&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the later chap-book version this is altered into&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Turn again, Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord Mayor of great London."</span><br />
</p>

<p>It will be seen that the special reference to the fact that Whittington
was three times Lord Mayor is not to be found in either the ballads or
the chap-books.</p>

<p>In the <i>Life</i>, by the author of <i>George Barnwell</i> (1811), however we
read&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Return again, Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thrise Lord Mayor of London."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in <i>The Life and Times of Whittington</i> (1841)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Turn again, turn again, Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three times Lord Mayor of London."</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the early version of the <i>History</i> by T. H. the fanciful portions are
only allowed to occupy a small portion of the whole, and a long account
is given of Whittington's real actions, but, in the later chap-book
versions, the historical incidents are ruthlessly cut down, and the
fictitious ones amplified. This will be seen by comparing the two
printed here. Thus T. H. merely says (p. 6) that Whittington was
obscurely born, and that being almost starved in the country he came up
to London. In the later chap-book the journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> to London is more fully
enlarged upon (p. xxxiii.), and among those at Whittington's marriage
with Alice Fitzwarren the name of the Company of Stationers not then in
existence is foisted in (pp. xlii.) It does not appear in T. H.'s
<i>History</i>.</p>

<p>In many other particulars the later chap-book which contains the story
as known to modern readers is amplified, and thus shows signs of a very
late origin.</p>

<p>With regard to the three fictitious points of Whittington's history
mentioned at the beginning of this preface, the first&mdash;his poor
parentage&mdash;is disposed of by documentary evidence; the second&mdash;his
sitting on a stone at Highgate hill&mdash;has been shown to be quite a modern
invention; and the third&mdash;the story of the cat&mdash;has been told of so many
other persons in different parts of the world that there is every reason
to believe it to be a veritable folk-tale joined to the history of
Whittington from some unexplained connection. None of the early
historians who mention Whittington allude to the incident of the cat,
and it is only to be found in popular literature, ballads, plays, &amp;c.
The story seems to have taken its rise in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
The reason why however the life of Whittington should have been chosen
as the stock upon which this folk-tale should be grafted is still
unexplained. Some have supposed that he obtained his money by the
employment of "cats," or vessels for the carriage of coals; but this
suggestion does not appear to be worthy of much consideration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that at Newgate, which owed much to Whittington, there was a
statue of him with a cat, which was destroyed in the Great Fire; and in
1862, when some alterations were made in an old house at Gloucester,
which had been occupied by the Whittington family until 1460, a stone
was said to have been dug up on which was a basso-relievo representing
the figure of a boy carrying a cat in his arms. This find, however,
appears rather suspicious.</p>

<p>Keightley devotes a whole chapter of his <i>Tales and Popular Fictions</i> to
the legend of Whittington and his Cat, in which he points out how many
similar stories exist. The <i>Facezie</i>, of Arlotto, printed soon after the
author's death in 1483, contain a tale of a merchant of Genoa, entitled
"Novella delle Gatte," and probably from this the story came to England,
although it is also found in a German chronicle of the thirteenth
century. Sir William Ouseley, in his <i>Travels</i>, 1819, speaking of an
island in the Persian Gulf, relates, on the authority of a Persian MS.,
that "in the tenth century, one Keis, the son of a poor widow in Sir&aacute;f,
embarked for India with a cat, his only property. There he fortunately
arrived at a time when the palace was so infested by mice or rats that
they invaded the king's food, and persons were employed to drive them
from the royal banquet. Keis produced his cat; the noxious animals soon
disappeared, and magnificent rewards were bestowed on the adventurer of
Sir&aacute;f, who returned to that city, and afterwards, with his mother and
brothers, settled on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> the island, which from him has been denominated
Keis, or according to the Persians Keisch." Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps
quotes from the <i>Description of Guinea</i> (1665) the record of "how
Alphonso, a Portuguese, being wrecked on the coast of Guinney, and being
presented by the king thereof with his weight in gold for a cat to kill
their mice; and an oyntment to kill their flies, which he improved
within five years to 6000<i>l.</i> in the place, and, returning to Portugal
after fifteen years traffick, became the third man in the kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Keightley also quotes two similar stories from Thiele's <i>Danish Popular
Traditions</i> and another from the letters of Count Magalotti, a
Florentine of the latter half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives much information as to the great value of cats in the
Middle Ages, but the writer of the <i>History of Whittington</i> does not
lead us to believe that they were dear in England, for he makes the boy
buy his cat for one penny. The two following titles are from the
Stationers' Registers. The ballad is probably the one subsequently
referred to as by Richard Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe birthe, his great
fortune, as yt was plaied by the Prynces Servants. Licensed to Thomas
Pavyer, Feb. 8, 1604-5."</p>

<p>"A Ballad, called The vertuous lyfe and memorable death of Sir Richard
Whittington, mercer, sometymes Lord Maiour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> of the honorable Citie of
London. Licensed to John Wright, 16 July, 1605."</p>

<p>The first reference that we find to the cat incident is in the play
<i>Eastward Hoe</i> by Chapman, Ben Jonson, and Marston; for, as the portrait
which was said to have existed at Mercers' Hall is not now known, it can
scarcely be put in evidence. This half-length portrait of a man of about
sixty years of age, dressed in a livery gown and black cap of the time
of Henry VIII. with a figure of a black and white cat on the left, is
said to have had painted in the left-hand upper corner of the canvas the
inscription, "R. Whittington, 1536."</p>

<p>In <i>Eastward Hoe</i>, 1605, Touchstone assures Goulding that he hopes to
see him reckoned one of the worthies of the city of London "When the
famous fable of Whittington and his puss shall be forgotten."</p>

<p>The next allusion is in Thomas Heywood's <i>If you know not me, you know
nobody</i>, 2nd part, 1606.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Dean Nowell.</i> "This Sir Richard Whittington, three times Mayor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sonne to a knight and prentice to a mercer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Began the Library of Grey-Friars in London,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his executors after him did build</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whittington Colledge, thirteene Alms-houses for poore men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Repair'd S. Bartholomewes, in Smithfield,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glased the Guildhall, and built Newgate.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Hobson.</i> Bones of men, then I have heard lies;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I have heard he was a scullion,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rais'd himself by venture of a cat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Nowell.</i> They did the more wrong to the gentleman."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Here it will be seen that, although the popular tale is mentioned, it is
treated as a mere invention unworthy of credence.</p>

<p>The next in point of time is the ballad by Richard Johnson, published in
the <i>Crowne Garland of Goulden Roses</i> (1612), which probably had a much
earlier existence in a separate form. It is the earliest form of the
story of Whittington now in existence.</p>

<p><i>A song of Sir Richard Whittington, who by strange fortunes came to bee
thrice Lord Maior of London; with his bountifull guifts and liberallity
given to this honourable Citty.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(To the tune of "<i>Dainty come thou to me</i>.")</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Here must I tell the praise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of worthie Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Known to be in his dayes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thrice Maior of London.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But of poor parentage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Borne was he, as we heare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in his tender age</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bred up in Lancashire.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poorely to London than</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Came up this simple lad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where, with a marchant-man,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soone he a dwelling had;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in a kitchen plast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A scullion for to be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereas long time he past</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In labour grudgingly.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His daily service was</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Turning spits at the fire;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to scour pots of brasse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For a poore scullions hire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meat and drinke all his pay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of coyne he had no store;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore to run away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In secret thought he bore.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So from this marchant-man</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whittington secretly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Towards his country ran,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To purchase liberty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as he went along</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a fair summer's morne,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">London bells sweetly rung,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Whittington, back return!'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Evermore sounding so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Turn againe, Whittington;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For thou in time shall grow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lord-Maior of London.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereupon back againe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whittington came with speed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Aprentise to remaine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the Lord had decreed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Still blessed be the bells'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(This was his daily song),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'They my good fortune tells,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Most sweetly have they rung.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But see his happy chance!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This scullion had a cat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which did his state advance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And by it wealth he gat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His maister ventred forth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To a land far unknowne,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With marchandize of worth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And is in stories shewne.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whittington had no more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But this poor cat as than,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which to the ship he bore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like a brave marchant-man.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Vent'ring the same,' quoth he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'I may get store of golde,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Maior of London be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the bells have me told.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whittington's marchandise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Carried was to a land</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Troubled with rats and mice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As they did understand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king of that country there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As he at dinner sat,</span><br />

</p>

<p>This ballad, as it stands here with the exception of the last stanza,
was reprinted in <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, 1823, vol. i. p. 130.</p>

<p>This ballad is the original of all the later ballads, although the
titles have been greatly varied. The Roxburghe ballad (vol. iii. p. 58)
is dated in the British Museum Catalogue 1641[?]. Its full title is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"London's Glory and Whittington's Renown, or a Looking Glass for
Citizens of London, being a remarkable story how Sir Richard Whittington
(a poor boy bred up in Lancashire) came to be three times Lord Mayor of
London in three several kings' reigns, and how his rise was by a cat,
which he sent by a venture beyond sea. Together with his bountiful gifts
and liberality given to this honourable City, and the vast sums of money
he lent the King to maintain the wars in France; and how at a great
Feast, to which he invited the King, the Queen, and the Nobility, he
generously burnt the writings and freely forgave his Majesty the whole
Debt. Tune of 'Dainty, come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> thou to me.' London: Printed for R. Burton,
at the Horse Shoe in West Smithfield."</p>

<p>The bulk of the ballad is the same as Richard Johnson's, but the
following first stanza is added, the original first stanza becoming the
second:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Brave London Prentices,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come listen to my song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tis for your glory all</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to you both belong.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you poor country lads,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though born of low degree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See by God's providence</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What you in time may be."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The second half of the original seventh stanza, and the eighth, ninth,
and tenth stanzas, are left out.</p>

<p>Immediately before the last stanza the following one is introduced:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Let all kynde Citizens</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who do this story read,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By his example learn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Always the poor to feed.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is lent to the poor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Lord will sure repay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blessings keep in store</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Until the latter day."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The other alterations are not many, and chiefly consist in
transpositions by which the rhymes are varied. This may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> seen by
comparing with the original the Roxburghe version of the last stanza
which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lancashire, thou hast bred</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This flower of charity;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though he be dead and gone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet lives his memory.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those bells that call'd him so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Turn again, Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would they call may moe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such men to fair London."</span><br />
</p>

<p>At the end of one of the chap-books there is a version of the ballad in
which Lancashire is replaced by Somersetshire.</p>

<p>In the same volume of the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> (p. 470) is a short
version [1710?] containing a few only of the verses taken from the
ballad. It is illustrated with some woodcuts from T. H.'s earlier
<i>History</i>.</p>

<p>"An old Ballad of Whittington and his Cat, who from a poor boy came to
be thrice Lord Mayor of London. Printed and sold in Aldermary Church
Yard, London."</p>

<p>There is a copy of this in the Chetham Library.</p>

<p>The following are some of the chief references to Whittington's story in
literature after the publication of Johnson's ballad, arranged in
chronological order:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"As if a new-found Whittington's rare cat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come to extoll their birth-rights above that</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which nature once intended."&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Stephens's <i>Essayes and Characters</i>, 1615.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Faith, how many churches do you mean to build</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before you die? Six bells in every steeple,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let them all go to the <i>City tune</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Turn again, Whittington</i>, and who they say</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew rich, and let his land out for nine lives,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Cause all came in by a cat."&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Shirley's <i>Constant Maid</i> (1640), act ii. sc. 2.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have heard of Whittington and his cat, and others, that have
made fortunes by strange means."&mdash;Parson's <i>Wedding</i> (1664).</p></div>

<p>Pepys went on September 21, 1668, to Southwark Fair, "and there saw the
puppet show of Whittington, which was pretty to see." He adds in his
<i>Diary</i> "how that idle thing do work upon people that see it, and even
myself too."</p>

<p>In the <i>Tatler</i> of September 13, 1709 (No. 67), is a list of great men
to be entered in the Temple of Fame, and in the subsequent No. 78 is
printed the following letter from a Citizen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff, Sir, Your <i>Tatler</i> of September 13 I am now
reading, and in your list of famous men desire you not to forget
Alderman Whittington, who began the world with a cat, and died
worth three hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, which he
left to an only daughter three years after his mayoralty. If you
want any further particulars of ditto Alderman, daughter, or cat,
let me know, and per first will advise the needful, which
concludes,<br />
Your loving Friend, <span class="smcap">Lemuel Leger</span>."</p>

<p>"I am credibly informed that there was once a design of casting
into an opera the story of Whittington and his Cat, and that in
order to it there had been got together a great quantity of mice;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>but Mr. Rich, the proprietor of the playhouse, very prudently
considered that it would be impossible for the cat to kill them
all, and that consequently the princes of the stage might be as
much infested with mice as the prince of the island was before the
cat's arrival upon it; for which reason he would not permit it to
be acted in his house."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i> (No. 5, March 6, 1711).</p></div>

<p>The Rev. Samuel Pegge brought the subject of Whittington and his Cat
before a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in 1771, but he could
make nothing at all of the cat. There is no record of the inquiry in the
<i>Archaeologia</i>, but it is mentioned in a letter from Gough to Tyson, 27
Dec. 1771 (Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. viii. p. 575). Horace
Walpole was annoyed at the Society for criticising his "Richard III."
and in his <i>Short Notes on his Life</i> he wrote&mdash;"Foote having brought
them on the stage for sitting in council, as they had done on
Whittington and his Cat, I was not sorry to find them so ridiculous, or
to mark their being so, and upon that nonsense, and the laughter that
accompanied it, I struck my name out of their book."</p>

<p>Foote brought out his comedy of <i>The Nabob</i> at the Haymarket Theatre in
1772. Sir Matthew Mite, the hero of the piece, is elected a member of
the Society of Antiquaries, and delivers an address on Whittington and
his Cat in which he gave the following solution of the difficulty:&mdash;"The
commerce this worthy merchant carried on was chiefly confined to our
coasts. For this purpose he constructed a vessel which for its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> agility
and lightness he aptly christened a cat. Nay, to this our day,
gentlemen, all our coals from Newcastle are imported in nothing but
cats. From thence it appears that it was not the whiskered four-footed,
mouse-killing cat that was the source of the magistrate's wealth, but
the coasting, sailing, coal-carrying cat; that, gentlemen, was
Whittington's cat."</p>

<p>We may now pass from the fictitious to the real Richard Whittington, and
although this is not the place for a life of the distinguished citizen,
which may be found elsewhere, it will be convenient to set down in order
the chief incidents of his career.</p>

<p>Richard Whittington was the third son of Sir William Whittington,
knight, of Pauntley, Gloucestershire, and it is assumed, by some
writers, that he was born in or about the year 1360. We must, however,
place his birth at an earlier date, for his name appears in the city
<i>Letter Book</i>, H, fol. 110<i>a</i>, (as Richard Whyttingdone), in the second
year of Richard II. (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1379), as a contributor of five marks
towards a loan to the city authorities; about four-fifths of the
subscribers contributing the same, which is the lowest figure among the
contributions.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This is the first appearance of Whittington's name in
the city books. William, the eldest son, succeeded to the family
property of Pauntley, but, dying without issue, the estate went to
Robert, the second son, who became high sheriff of the county in 1402,
and again in 1407. Pauntley remained in the family as late as 1546.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is known of Richard's early life, either as to when or how he
came to London. He appears to have married Alice, daughter of Hugh
Fitzwarren, and probably he was originally apprenticed to his
father-in-law, whose name appears in all the versions of his history.</p>

<p>The second appearance of Whittington's name in the city books is in 8
Richard II., when he was one of the eight common councilmen for Coleman
Street ward. In 11 Richard II. he is named as becoming surety to the
chamberlain in the sum of ten pounds towards providing money for defence
of the city. In the following year he appears to have been no longer a
member for Coleman Street ward. On the 12th of March, 1393, he is named
as then chosen alderman of Broad Street ward; and on 21st September of
the same year he was chosen by the mayor, William Staundon, one of the
sheriffs for the ensuing year.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>When Adam Bamme died in the year 1397, during his mayoralty, Richard II.
arbitrarily put Whittington in his place, and at the lord mayor's day of
that year Whittington again filled the office, being then regularly
elected.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From his will we find that this king, who was a member of
the Mercers' Company, to which Whittington was apprenticed, was an
especial patron of his. In 1400 he was excused from attending the
Scottish wars, and in 1406 he was again elected mayor. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> rebuilt his
parish church, and Mr. Riley has printed in his valuable <i>Memorials</i> (p.
578) the grant by Whittington of land or the re-building of the church
of St. Michael, Paternoster, "in the street called La Riole," called
after the merchants of La Riole, a town near Bordeaux, who had
established themselves there.</p>

<p>Whittington was knighted by Henry V., and in 1419 he was elected mayor
for the fourth time. It was in this year that John Carpenter commenced
the compilation of his famous <i>Liber Albus</i>. We see how highly this
distinguished citizen was appreciated from the writings of such men as
Grafton and Stow. Richard Grafton writes in his <i>Chronicle</i> (1569, p.
433)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This yere (1406) a worthie citizen of London, named Rychard
Whittyngton, mercer and alderman, was elected maior of the sayde
citie, and bare that office three tymes. This worshipfull man so
bestowed his goodes and substaunce to the honor of God, to the
reliefe of the pore, and to the benefite of the comon weale, that
he hath right well deserved to be regestered in the boke of fame.
First, he erected one house or church in London to be a house of
prayer, and he named the same after his awne name Whittyngtons
College, and so it remayneth to this day. And in the same church,
besydes certeine priestes and clerkes, he placed a number of poore
aged men and women and buylded for them houses and lodgyngs, and
allowed unto them wood, cole, cloth, and weekly money to their
great reliefe and comfort.... He also buylded for the ease of the
maior of London and his brethren, and of the worshipfull <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>citizens
at the solempne dayes of their assemblye, a chapell adioining to
the Guyldhall, to the entent they should euer before they entered
into any of theyr affayrs first to go into the chappel, and by
prayer to call upon God for assistaunce.... He also buylded a great
part of the east ende of the Guildhall, besyde many other good
workes that I knowe not. But among all other I will shewe unto you
one very notable, which I receyved credibly by a writyng of his
awne hande, which also he willed to be fixed as a schedule to his
last will and testament, the contentes whereof was that he willed
and commaunded his executors as they would aunswere before God at
the day of the resurrection of all fleshe, that if they found any
debtor of his that ought to him any money, that if he were not in
their consciences well worth three tymes as much, and also out of
the debt of other men, and well able to pay, that then they shoulde
never demaund it, for he cleerely forgave it, and that they should
put no man in sute for any debt due to him. Looke upon thys, ye
aldermen, for it is a glorious glasse."</p></div>

<p>Stow writes as follows in his <i>Survey of London</i> on some of
Whittington's good works:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Richard Whittington, mercer, three times mayor, in the year 1421
began the library of the grey friars in London, to the charge of
four hundred pounds: his executors with his goods founded and built
Whittington College, with almshouses for thirteen poor men, and
divinity lectures to be read there for ever. They repaired St.
Bartholomew's hospital in Smithfield; they bare half the charges of
building the library there, and they built the west gate of London,
of old time called Newgate," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>"The 1st year of Henry VI. John Coventrie and John Carpenter,
executors to Richard Whitington, gave towards the paving of this
great hall twenty pounds, and the next year fifteen pounds more, to
the said pavement, with hard stone of Purbeck; they also glazed
some windows thereof, and of the mayor's court; on every which
windows the arms of Richard Whitington are placed."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>Respecting the library at Guildhall, Stow, after relating how the Duke
of Somerset, Lord Protector, borrowed the books and never returned them,
writes:&mdash;"This library was built by the executors of Richard Whittington
and by William Burie; the arms of Whittington are placed on the one side
in the stone work, and two letters, to wit W and B, for William Burie,
on the other side; it is now lofted through, and made a storehouse for
clothes."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Whittington appears to have died childless, and in the interesting
picture of his deathbed, copied by Mr. Lysons from an illumination in
the ordinances of his college, his executors are seen around his bed.
His will was proved in 1423 by John Coventry, John White, William Grove
and John Carpenter. The College of St. Spirit and St. Mary consisted of
a master, four fellows (masters of arts), clerks, conducts, chorists,
&amp;c. It was dissolved by Edward VI.; but the memory of it remains in the
name College Hill, Upper Thames Street. God's House or Hospital for
thirteen poor men was moved to Highgate in 1808.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>By his will Whittington directed that the inmates of his college should
pray for the souls of himself and his wife Alice, of Sir William
Whittington, and his wife Dame Joan, of Hugh Fitzwarren and his wife
Dame Malde, as well as for the souls of Richard II. and Thomas of
Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, "special lords and promoters of the said
Whittington."</p>

<p>Whittington's epitaph is preserved by Stow and is in Latin; yet the
author of a <i>Life of Whittington</i> (1811) makes the following
misstatement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Record, however, has handed down to us the original epitaph, as it
was cut on the monument of Sir Richard, by order of his executors;
and, exclusive of its connection with the subject of these pages,
it may be subjoined as a curious specimen of the poetry of an age
which was comparatively with the present so entirely involved in
the darkness of superstition and ignorance."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Beneath this stone lies Whittington,</span><br />

<p>The following extract from Granger's <i>History of England</i> is curious as

<h4>THE</h4>
<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<h4>OF</h4>
<h2>WHITTINGTON.</h2>


<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dick Whittington was a very little boy when his father and mother
died; little indeed, that he never knew them, nor the place <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>where
he was born. He strolled about the country as ragged as a colt,
till he met with a waggoner who was going to London, and who gave
him leave to walk all the way by the side of his waggon without
paying anything for his passage, which pleased little Whittington
very much, as he wanted to see London badly, for he had heard that
the streets were paved with gold, and he was willing to get a
bushel of it; but how great was his disappointment, poor boy! when
he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold, and found
himself in a strange place, without a friend, without food, and
without money.</p>

<p>Though the waggoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the
side of the waggon for nothing, he took care not to know him when
he came to town, and the poor boy was, in a little time, so cold
and so hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and by a
warm fire in the country.</p>

<p>In this distress he asked charity of several people, and one of
them bid him "Go to work for an idle rogue." "That I will," says
Whittington, "with all my heart; I will work for you if you will
let me."</p>

<p>The man, who thought this favoured of wit and impertinence (tho'
the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work), gave him
a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran
down. In this situation, and fainting for want of food, he laid
himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a merchant, where
the cook saw him, and, being an ill-natured hussey, ordered him to
go about his business or she would scald him. At this time Mr.
Fitzwarren came from the Exchange, and began also to scold at the
poor boy, bidding him to go to work.</p>

<p>Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if any <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>body
would employ him, and that he should be able if he could get some
victuals to eat, for he had had nothing for three days, and he was
a poor country boy, and knew nobody, and nobody would employ him.</p>

<p>He then endeavoured to get up, but he was so very weak that he fell
down again, which excited so much compassion in the merchant that
he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and
drink, and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had
to set him about. People are too apt to reproach those who beg with
being idle, but give themselves no concern to put them in the way
of getting business to do, or considering whether they are able to
do it, which is not charity.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Think of this ye affluent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And when the overplus of your fortunes disturb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your minds, think how little stops the lash of penury,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And makes the wretched happy!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>I remember a circumstance of this sort, which Sir William Thompson
told my father with tears in his eyes, and it is so affecting that
I shall never forget it:</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3><a name="STORY" id="STORY"></a>STORY</h3>
<h4>OF</h4>
<h3>SIR WILLIAM THOMPSON.</h3>


<p>"When Sir William Thompson was in the plantation abroad, one of his
friends told him he had an indentured servant whom he had just
bought, that was his countryman and a lusty man; 'but he is so
idle,' says he, 'that I cannot get him to work.' 'Aye,' says Sir
William, 'let me see him.' Accordingly they walked out <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>together
and found the man sitting on a heap of stones. Upon this Sir
William, after enquiring about his country, asked why he did not go
out to work. 'I am not able,' answered the man. 'Not able?' says
Sir William, 'I am sure you look very well; give him a few
stripes.' Upon this the planter struck him several times, but the
poor man still kept his seat.</p>

<p>"Then they left him to look over the plantation, exclaiming against
his obstinacy all the way they went; but how surprised were they,
on their return, to find the poor man fallen from off the place
where he had been sitting, and dead! 'The cruelty,' says Sir
William, 'of my ordering the poor man to be beaten while in the
agonies of death lies always next my heart. It is what I shall
never forget, and will for ever prevent my judging rashly of people
who appear in distress. How do we know what our children may come
to? The Lord have mercy upon the poor, and defend them from the
proud, the inconsiderate, and the avaricious."</p>

<p>But we return to Whittington: who would have lived happy in this
worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook, who
must be always roasting or basting, and when the spit was still
employed her hands upon poor Whittington! 'till Miss Alice, his
master's daughter, was informed of it, and then she took compassion
on the poor boy, and made the servants treat him kindly.</p>

<p>Besides the crossness of the cook, Whittington had another
difficulty to get over before he could be happy. He had, by order
of his master, a flock-bed placed for him in a garret, where there
were such a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor
boy's nose and disturbed him in his sleep. After some time,
however, a gentleman, who came to his master's house, gave
Whitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>ton a penny for brushing his shoes. This he put into his
pocket, being determined to lay it out to the best advantage; and
the next day, seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her
arm, he ran up to know the price of it. The woman (as the cat was a
good mouser) asked a deal of money for it, but on Whittington's
telling her he had but a penny in the world, and that he wanted a
cat sadly, she let him have it.</p>

<p>This cat Whittington concealed in the garret, for fear she should
be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook, and here she soon
killed or frightened away the rats and mice, so that the poor boy
could now sleep as sound as a top.</p>

<p>Soon after this the merchant, who had a ship ready to sail, called
for his servants, as his custom was, in order that each of them
might venture something to try their luck; and whatever they sent
was to pay neither freight nor custom, for he thought justly that
God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the
poor partake of his fortune. "He that giveth to the poor lendeth to
the Lord, who will return it seventy-fold."</p>

<p>All the servants appeared but poor Whittington, who, having neither
money nor goods, could not think of sending anything to try his
luck; but his good friend Miss Alice, thinking his poverty kept him
away, ordered him to be called.</p>

<p>She then offered to lay down something for him, but the merchant
told his daughter that would not do, it must be something of his
own. Upon which poor Whittington said he had nothing but a cat
which he bought for a penny that was given him. "Fetch thy cat,
boy," said the merchant, "and send her." Whittington brought poor
puss and delivered her to the captain, with tears in his eyes, for
he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>mice as much as
ever. All the company laughed at the adventure but Miss Alice, who
pitied the poor boy, and gave him something to buy another cat.</p>

<p>While puss was beating the billows at sea, poor Whittington was
severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook, who
used him so cruelly, and made such game of him for sending his cat
to sea, that at last the poor boy determined to run away from his
place, and, having packed up the few things he had, he set out very
early in the morning on All-Hallows day. He travelled as far as
Holloway, and there sat down on a stone to consider what course he
should take; but while he was thus ruminating, Bow bells, of which
there were only six, began to ring; and he thought their sounds
addressed him in this manner:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Turn again, Whittington,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord Mayor of great London."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Lord Mayor of London!" said he to himself; "what would not one
endure to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in such a fine coach?
Well, I'll go back again, and bear all the pummelling and ill-usage
of Cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being Lord Mayor!" So
home he went, and happily got into the house and about his business
before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance.</p>

<p>We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa, to that coast
where Dido expired for loss of &AElig;nus (<i>sic</i>). How perilous are
voyages at sea, how uncertain the winds and the waves, and how many
accidents attend a naval life!</p>

<p>The ship, which had the cat on board, was long beaten at sea, and
at last, by contrary winds, driven on a part of the coast of
Barbary which was inhabited by Moors, unknown to the English. These
people received our countrymen with civility, and therefore <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>the
captain, in order to trade with them, shewed them the patterns of
the goods he had on board, and sent some of them to the king of the
country, who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain and
the factor to his palace, which was about a mile from the sea. Here
they were placed, according to the custom of the country, on rich
carpets, flowered with gold and silver; and the king and queen
being seated at the upper end of the room, dinner was brought in,
which consisted of many dishes; but no sooner were the dishes put
down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all quarters,
and devoured all the meat in an instant. The factor, in surprise,
turned round to the nobles and asked "If these vermin were not
offensive?" "O yes," said they, "very offensive; and the king would
give half his treasure to be freed of them, for they not only
destroy his dinner, as you see, but they assault him in his
chamber, and even in bed, so that he is obliged to be watched while
he is sleeping for fear of them."</p>

<p>The factor jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington and his
cat, and told the king he had a creature on board the ship that
would despatch all these vermin immediately. The king's heart
heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his turban
dropped off his head. "Bring this creature to me," says he; "vermin
are dreadful in a court, and if she will perform what you say, I
will load your ship with gold and jewels in exchange for her." The
factor, who knew his business, took this opportunity to set forth
the merits of Miss Puss. He told his majesty "That it would be
inconvenient to part with her, as, when she was gone, the rats and
mice might destroy the goods in the ship&mdash;but to oblige his majesty
he would fetch her." "Run, run," said the queen; "I am impatient to
see the dear creature."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>

<p>Away flew the factor, while another dinner was providing, and
returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that
also. He immediately put down Mrs. Puss, who killed a great number
of them.</p>

<p>The king rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so
small a creature, and the queen was highly pleased, and desired the
cat might be brought near that she might look at her. Upon which
the factor called "Pussy, pussy, pussy," and she came to him. He
then presented her to the queen, who started back, and was afraid
to touch a creature who had made such a havoc among the rats and
mice; however, when the factor stroked the cat and called "Pussy,
pussy," the queen also touched her and cried "Putty, putty," for
she had not learned English.</p>

<p>He then put her down on the queen's lap, where she, purring, played
with her majesty's hand, and then sung herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The king having seen the exploits of Mrs. Puss, and being informed
that she was with young, and would stock the whole country,
bargained with the captain and factor for the whole ship's cargo,
and then gave them ten times as much for the cat as all the rest
amounted to. With which, taking leave of their majesties, and other
great personages at court, they sailed with a fair wind for
England, whither we must now attend them.</p>

<p>The morn had scarcely dawned when Mr. Fitzwarren stole from the bed
of his beloved wife, to count over the cash, and settle the
business for that day. He had just entered the compting-house, and
seated himself at the desk, when somebody came, tap, tap, at the
door. "Who's there?" says Mr. Fitzwarren. "A friend," answered the
other. "What friend can come at this unseasonable time?" "A real
friend is never unseasonable," answered the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>other. "I come to
bring you good news of your ship <i>Unicorn</i>." The merchant bustled
up in such an hurry that he forgot his gout; instantly opened the
door, and who should be seen waiting but the captain and factor,
with a cabinet of jewels, and a bill of lading, for which the
merchant lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for sending him such
a prosperous voyage. Then they told him the adventures of the cat,
and shewed him the cabinet of jewels which they had brought for Mr.
Whittington. Upon which he cried out with great earnestness, but
not in the most poetical manner,&mdash;
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go, send him in, and tell him of his fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And call him Mr. Whittington by name."</span>
</p>

<p>It is not our business to animadvert upon these lines; we are not
critics, but historians. It is sufficient for us that they are the
words of Mr. Fitzwarren; and though it is beside our purpose, and
perhaps not in our power to prove him a good poet, we shall soon
convince the reader that he was a good man, which was a much better
character; for when some, who were present, told him that this
treasure was too much for such a poor boy as Whittington, he said,
"God forbid that I should deprive him or a penny; it is his own,
and he shall have it to a farthing." He then ordered Mr.
Whittington in, who was at this time cleaning the kitchen, and
would have excused himself from going into the compting-house,
saying, the room was rubbed, and his shoes were dirty and full of
hob-nails. The merchant, however, made him come in, and ordered a
chair to be set for him. Upon which, thinking they intended to make
sport of him, as had been too often the case in the kitchen, he
besought his master not to mock a poor simple fellow, who intended
them no harm, but let him go about his business. The merchant,
taking him by the hand, said, "Indeed, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>Mr. Whittington, I am in
earnest with you, and sent for you to congratulate you on your
great success. Your cat has procured you more money than I am worth
in the world, and may you long enjoy it and be happy."</p>

<p>At length, being shown the treasure, and convinced by them that all
of it belonged to him, he fell upon his knees and thanked the
Almighty for his providential care of such a poor and miserable
creature. He then laid all the treasure at his master's feet, who
refused to take any part of it, but told him he heartily rejoiced
at his prosperity, and hoped the wealth he had acquired would be a
comfort to him, and would make him happy. He then applied to his
mistress, and to his good friend Miss Alice, who refused to take
any part of the money, but told him she heartily rejoiced at his
good success, and wished him all imaginable felicity. He then
gratified the captain, factor, and the ship's crew, for the care
they had taken of his cargo. He likewise distributed presents to
all the servants in the house, not forgetting even his old enemy
the cook, though she little deserved it.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised Mr. Whittington to send for the
necessary people and dress himself like a gentleman, and made him
the offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself
with a better.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that when Mr. Whittington's face was washed,
his hair curled, and dressed in a rich suit of clothes, that he
turned out a genteel young fellow; and, as wealth contributes much
to give a man confidence, he in a little time dropped that sheepish
behaviour which was principally occasioned by a depression of
spirits, and soon grew a sprightly and good companion, insomuch
that Miss Alice, who had formerly seen him with an eye <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>of
compassion, now viewed him with other eyes, which perhaps was in
some measure occasioned by his readiness to oblige her, and by
continually making her presents of such things that he thought
would be most agreeable.</p>

<p>When her father perceived they had this good liking for each other
he proposed a match between them, to which both parties cheerfully
consented, and the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, Sheriffs, the
Company of Stationers, and a number of eminent merchants attended
the ceremony, and were elegantly treated at an entertainment made
for that purpose.</p>

<p>History further relates that they lived very happy, had several
children, and died at a good old age. Mr. Whittington served
Sheriff of London in the year 1340, and was three times Lord Mayor.
In the last year of his mayoralty he entertained King Henry V. and
his Queen, after his conquest of France, upon which occasion the
King, in consideration of Whittington's merit, said, "Never had
prince such a subject;" which being told to Whittington at the
table, he replied "Never had subject such a king." His Majesty, out
of respect to his good character, conferred the honour of
knighthood on him soon after.</p>

<p>Sir Richard many years before his death constantly fed a great
number of poor citizens, built a church and a college to it, with a
yearly allowance for poor scholars, and near it erected an
hospital. He also built Newgate for criminals, and gave liberally
to St. Bartholomew's Hospital and other public charities.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two old houses in London, which were pulled down at the beginning of the
present century, have been associated with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> name of Whittington, but
there is no evidence that he really dwelt in either of them. One ruinous
building in Sweedon's Passage, Grub Street, engravings of which will be
found in J.T. Smith's <i>Topography of London</i>, was pulled down in 1805,
and five houses built on its site. A tablet was then set up, on which
was an inscription to the effect that the house had been called Gresham
House, and that Whittington once inhabited it.</p>

<p>The magnificent house which stood in Hart Street, Crutched Friars, a few
doors from Mark Lane, is said to have been called Whittington's palace
in the old leases, but this is the only evidence in favour of the
popular belief. The front was elaborately carved in oak, the work of a
much later date than that of Whittington. The decoration is attributed
to the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII., and on the ceiling among
other forms was that of a cat's head, from which possibly the tradition
of its having been the residence of Whittington arose. There was a
popular superstition that the cat's eyes followed the visitor as he
walked about the room. This house was taken down in 1801, but both it
and the house in Sweedon's Passage were reproduced in the interesting
Old London Street at the International Health Exhibition of 1884.</p>

<h2><i>The Printer to the Reader.</i></h2>


<p>Courteous Reader,&mdash;I here present unto thee no strange or forreign news,
no imagination, or vain conceit of poetical fiction; neither do I tell
thee of Gallagantua or of the Red Rose Knight, nor such like stories;
but I here offer to thy view a true pattern of humility; being the glory
of our Kingdom, and raised to Honour by desert; the title tells you that
it is the life and death of Richard Whittington, who for his clemency
and understanding was three times chosen Lord Mayor of the Honourable
City of London, who always acknowledged his beginning to be of mean and
low rank; yet he was beloved of the King for his fidelity and trust, as
may appear in larger volumes, and the entertainment that he gave at his
own house to his Soveraign at several times: his bounty upon all
occasions, when the King wanted his purse; his love to the City and
Commons; which are not to be buried in oblivion, but rather to be
proclaimed as living monuments to all people of what condition soever,
to animate them never to be dejected though never so poor, as the story
will more at large declare; all which happened in the days of our
forefathers, and very probable it may be for us to believe; if we will
not give credit to former historians who will give the like to us in
future ages: read it through, and you will find something worthy of
note, and thou shall do thy self some pleasure and me a high favour.

<p>The saying is not so old as true, He that refuseth to buy counsel cheap
shall buy repentance dear; neither let any work [mock?] a man in his
misery, but rather beware by him how to avoid the like misfortune; if
thou intend to do any good, defer it not till the next day, for thou
knowest not what may happen over night to prevent thee. Behold thyself
in a looking glass, if thou appearest beautiful do such things as may
become thy beauty; but if thou seem foul or deformed, let the actions of
thy life make good that splendor which thy face lacketh. Tell not thy
mind to every man, make thy self indebted to no man, be friend to few
men, be courteous to all men, let thy wit be thy friend, thy mind thy
companion, thy tongue thy servant, let vertue be thy life, valour thy
love, honour thy fame and heaven thy felicity. These (Reader) be good
documents for thee to follow, and I am now to present thee with a
worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> president to imitate; observe his beginning, forget not the
middle passage of his life, and thou wilt no question crown his head. He
that made all things of nothing can of a little make much, and multiply
a mite into a magazine, as will easily appear by the succeeding history.</p>

<p>This Richard Whittington was so obscurely born that he could scarcely
give account of his parents or kindred, and being almost starved in the
country, necessity compelled him up to London, hoping to find more
charity in the town than in the country: to beg he was ashamed, to steal
he did abhor: two days he spent in gaping upon the shops and gazing upon
the buildings feeding his eyes but starving his stomach. At length meer
faintness compell'd him to rest himself upon a bench before a merchant's
gate, where he not long sat but the owner of the house having occasion
of business into the town finding him a poor simple fellow, and thinking
that he had no more within him than appeared without, demanded of him
why he loytered there, and being able to work for his living did not
apply himself unto some lawful calling, threatning him at the first with
the stocks and the whipping-post; but the poor man, after the making of
some plain leggs and courtesie, desired him to pardon him, and told him
that he was a dejected man, who desired any imployment, and that no
pains how mean or course (<i>sic</i>) soever could seem tedious or
burthensome unto him, so he might but find some good master, by whose
charity he might relieve his present necessity: for his great ambition
was but to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> keep his body from nakedness and his stomach from hunger,
and told him withal how long it was since he had tasted meat or drink.</p>

<p>The worthy merchant seeing him of a personable body, and an ingenious
aspect howsoever both were clouded under a rustick habit, began somewhat
to commiserate his estate, and knocking for a servant had him take in
that fellow and give him such victuals as the house for the present
afforded, and at his return he would have further conference with him.
The servant did as he was commanded and took him in.</p>

<p>The merchant went then to the Exchange, which was then in Lumber Street,
about his affairs; in which intrim (<i>sic</i>) poor Whittington was hied
into the kitchin to warm himself, for faintness by reason of hunger and
cold (for it was then in the winter time) had quite rob'd him of his
colour. Meat was set before him in plenty, and being bred in the
country, as the proverb goeth, <i>He fed like a farmer</i>, and having
satisfied himself sufficiently and warm'd him to the full, a fresh
colour began to come into his cheeks: at which the Merchant's daughter
(hearing of a new come guest) came into the kitchin, and began to
question him of divers things concerning the country, to all which he
gave her such modest and sensible answers that she took a great liking
unto him, and so left him.</p>

<p>Dinner time came, and Master Fitzwarren (for so was the merchant called)
came home with a good stomach, and brought a friend or two with him from
the Exchange; down they sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> to meat, and had speech of many things at
the table; meanwhile the servants were set also at dinner, who would
needs have Whittington, though he had so lately broke his fast, to keep
them company, some of them delighting in his country speech, others
deriding his supposed simplicity.</p>

<p>But to come to the purpose, the table being withdrawn in the parlour,
and the guests departed, and Master Fitzwarren and his daughter left
alone, she being of a good and gentle disposition, began to commend his
charity concerning the poor man whom he relieved that morning, to whom
he answered, God-a-mercy daughter, thou hast done well to remember me,
such a one I sent indeed, but have my servants done as I commanded them?
and where is he now? who answered him, that she had given order he
should stay dinner, and not depart the house till he himself had further
spoken with him. At which they both went unto the Hall, and called the
fellow before them; who appeared unto them with such a bashful humility
that it seemed to them both to beg a charity; some language past betwixt
them concerning him, which gave them content; at length they bid him
retire himself.</p>

<p>When the father and the daughter had some private conference concerning
him she urged him to entertain him into his house, and that there would
be some employment for him, either to run or to go of errands or else to
do some drudgery in the kitchin, as making of fires, scouring kettles,
turning the spit, and the like: To whom the father reply'd that indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
his work might be worth his meat, but he had no lodging to spare, and
she again answered that there were garrets in the house that were put to
no use at all, and in one of them he might conveniently be lodged and
put the house to no trouble at all.</p>

<p>Well at length he was admitted, and made a member of the family, in
which he demeaned himself so well by his willingness to run or go or do
any service how mean so ever that he had got the good will of all the
whole houshold, only the kitchin maid being a curst quean, and knowing
him to be an under servant to her, domineered over him and used him very
coursely and roughly, of which he would never complain, though he had
cause enough. The garret in which he lay, by reason it had been long
unfrequented, was troubled with rats and mice, insomuch that he could
not sleep in the night but they ran over his face, and much disturb'd
him in his rest: to prevent which having got a penny either for going of
an errand, or for making clean boots or shooes or the like, with that he
bought a young cat which he kept in his garret, and whatsoever he had
from the reversion of the servants table he would be sure to reserve
part for her, because he had found by experience that she had rid him of
the former inconveniences.</p>

<p>The History tells us that this merchant, Master Hugh Fitzwarren, was so
generous that he never adventured any ship to sea but he would have his
daughter, his cashire, and every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> of his servants, whar (<i>sic</i>) or
whatsoever, to put in something, and to adventure with him, and
according to that proportion which they could spare, every one received
to a token at the return of the ship. His daughter she began, the rest
followed, and the servants borrowed out of their wages everyone
according to their abilities, and when they all had done Whittington was
remembered and called for, and his master telling him the custome of his
home, asked him what he had to hazard in this adventure, who replyed
again, he was a poor man, and had nothing in the world saving the
cloaths upon his back, but for money he had none at all: then his
daughter drew out her purse and told her father, that for his servant
Whittington she would lay down whatsoever he would desire. Who answered
again, that what she had spoke was nothing to the purpose; for
whatsoever was ventured in that kind must be out of ones proper goods
and chattels, and again demanded of him if he had anything he could call
his own to put to hazard, and charged him deeply concerning that point,
who making some unnecessary leggs, told him that he had nothing which he
could call his saving a cat, which he had bought with his penny, which
he could not spare because she had done him so many good offices, and
told them every circumstance before, related, which when the merchant
heard he told him that he should venture that commodity and none else,
and charged him to fetch her instantly (for the ship which was called
the Unicorn) was fallen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> down as low as Blackwal and all their lading
was already had aboard. Whittington although unwilling to part from so
good a companion yet being forced by his masters command by whom he had
his subsistence he brought her and (not without tears) delivered her to
his factor who was partly glad of her, by reason they were troubled with
mice and rats in the ship, which not only spoyled their victuals but
damaged their wares and commodities.</p>

<p>I must leave the cat upon her voyage at sea and honest Whittington on
land, who by that cursed quean the kitchin maid was so beaten and abused
that he was as weary of his life as of his service: for she (usurping
upon his plainness and modesty) would be quarrelling with him, upon
every small or no occasion at all; sometimes beating him with the broom,
sometimes laying him over the shoulders with a laddle, the spit or what
came next to her hands, being of so dogged a disposition that she still
continued her cruelty towards him, and therefore he resolved with
himself to run away, and for that purpose he had bundled up those few
clothes which he had, and before day broke was got as far as Bunhill,
and then he sat down to consider with himself what course he were best
to take; where by chance (it being all-hallows day) a merry peal from
Bow Church began to ring, and as he apprehended they were tun'd to this
ditty,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>This took such a great impression in him, that finding how early it was,
and that he might yet come back in his masters house before any of the
family were stirring, he resolved to go back, and found every thing
according to his own wishes and desires, insomuch that when the
household were up none could challenge him to have been missing. And
thus he continued as before in his first plainness and honesty, well
beloved of all save the kitchin drudge; I come now to tell you what
became of his adventure.</p>

<p>It so hapned that this goodly ship Unicorn was by contrary gusts and bad
weather driven upon the utmost coast of Barbary, where never any
Englishman (or scarce any Christian) had ever traded before, where they
showed their commodities and offered them to be vended. The Moors came
down in multitudes, much taken with the beauty of their ship, for they
had never seen any of that bigness or burthen before, but when they had
taken a serious view of their commodities as hatchets, knives and
looking-glasses, fish-hooks, &amp;c. but especially their cloth and kersies
of several sizes and colours, they brought them gold in abundance for it
was more plentiful with them then (<i>sic</i>) lead or copper with us.</p>

<p>Presently the news was carryed to the king who sent some of his chief
nobility to bring him some sorts of every commodity that was aboard,
which when he saw they pleased him highly, sending for the master and
merchants factor to court.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> He at their own rate bargained with them for
their whole lading, nor would he suffer them to depart till he had
feasted them royally.</p>

<p>Now the fashion of the Moors is not to sit at the table as the custom is
among us, but to have a rich carpet spread upon the ground, and when the
meal or banquet is served in, as well the king himself as the rest sit
round about cross-legg'd as taylors commonly used to do upon their
shop-boards, and in that manner our English are set at the king's
banquet, but the meal was no sooner served in but swarms of rats and
mice seized upon the dishes, and snatched away the meat even from the
king and queen's trenchers: at which the factor being annoyed asked one
of the nobility (by an interpreter) if they preserved those vermin for
sport, or if they were noysome, and troublesome unto them: who answered
him again, that they were the greatest vexation unto them that could be
possible, and by reason of their multitudes they could not be destroyed,
but the king would willingly give half the revenue of his crown if he
could but only clear the court of them, for not only his table but his
very bed-chamber swarmed with them, insomuch that he durst not lay him
down to rest without a watch about him, to keep them off his pillow: To
whom the factor replyed, that they had a strange beast aboard which he
made no doubt would rid them of those vermine: which being told the king
he rose from his place and imbracing the factor told him if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> could
shew him such a creature he would ballast his vessel with silver and
lade her with gold and pearl. Who apprehending the occasion made very
coy of the business, telling him it was a creature of great value and
not common. Besides they could not spare her from the ship, in regard
when they were asleep yet she was still waking in the night, not only to
preserve their merchandise but there dyet from the like spoyl. The more
dainty that he made of the matter the more earnest was the king for this
beast, insomuch that he was presently sent for.</p>

<p>And a second feast being prepared and the rats and mice appearing as
they did before, the young merchant having the cat under his cloak the
king desired to see the thing which he had before so much commended;
when presently he discovered her, and cast her among them; she no sooner
saw these vermine but fell upon them with such a fury that here lay one
panting, there another quite dead; nor left them till she had frighted
and disperst the whole number, but such as she seized their carkasses
lay there as witnesses of their unexpected slaughter.</p>

<p>Great pleasure took the king and the nobility in the sport, vowing that
the hunting of the lyon (of which there was plenty in that country) was
not answerable unto it. In the interim one began to praise her for her
colour, another commending her for her valour, one said she had the
countenance of a lyon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> and every one gave his sentence. When the poor
cat finding no more work for her to do, went round to the King and Queen
purling and curling (as their manner is), which they apprehended to be,
as if she inquired of them what she had deserved for that late service.</p>

<p>To cut off circumstance, no price could part them, and the rather when
the factor had told the king that she was with kittens, and that her
brood would in some few years, being carefully lookt into, furnish the
whole kingdom, so that Whittingtons cats adventure only surmounted all
the ships lading beside, with which fortune and unexpected gain we bring
them safe into England; the ship lying at anchor near Blackwal, and the
Pilot and Cape-merchant, with some other officers in the ship at Mr.
Fitzwarrens house, which was by Leaden-Hall, to give accompt of their
voyage. But these caskets of jewels and pearls, with other unvaluable
(<i>sic</i>) riches which were given for the cat, they caused to be brought
along, not daring, by reason of their inestimable value, to trust them
in the ship. The Bills of lading and the benefit of the return of the
Commodities being viewed and considered of by the owner, he praised God
for so prosperous a voyage, and called all his servants and gave order
that according to their adventures every one should receive his portion.</p>

<p>At length casting his eye upon those rich caskets and cabinets, he asked
to whose share they belonged; who whispered him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> the ear, and told
him to his poor Whittington, relating every particular as is before
discoursed. To whom Master Fitzwarren replyed, if they then be his, God
forbid I should keep from him the least farthing that is his right, and
presently commanded Whittington to be sent for by the name of Mr.
Whittington.</p>

<p>The servants not knowing anything of the business, went unto him into
the kitchin, where he was then rubbing the spits, scouring the kettles,
and making clean the dressers, and told him he must come to his Master
presently into the parlor. The poor man excused himself, that his shooes
were dirty and the room was rubb'd, and if he should but touch any thing
there he should spoyl and deface those things in the room. But still the
master of the House called for Master Whittington, sending one servant
after another till he was brought before him; and having scraped some
few legs, instantly his master took him by the hand, and called for a
chair for Master Whittington, his daughter, the pilot, and the factor,
every one of them saluted him by the name of Mr. Whittington and forced
him to sit down. He wondering what this should mean desired them not to
mock a poor simple man who meant none any harm, &amp;c. and wept (the tears
dropping from his eyes), desiring them not to deride his poverty, for
his ambition was never to come so high as from the kitchin to the hall
much more from the hall to the parlor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came his master to him seriously and said, Indeed Mr. Whittington,
we are all in very good earnest, for you are at this time a better man
than myself in estate, and then shewed him all those cabinets and
caskets, and how richly they were lined.</p>

<p>When he perceived by all their earnest asservations that all was true he
first fell down upon his knees and gave God most hearty thanks, who out
of his great bounty would vouchsafe to cast an eye upon so poor and
wretched a creature as himself; then turning to his master he presented
all his riches before him and told him that all he had was at his
disposing and service, who answered him again, that for his own part God
had sent him sufficient of his own, neither would he take from him the
value of one Barbary ducket. He came nere and with a low leg saluted his
mistris, and told her that when she pleased to make choice of a husband
he would make her the richest marriage in London, because she was so
willing out of her own purse (when he was altogether penniless) to lay
out for his adventure. To the pilot, and master, and every officer, and
common saylor he gave liberal according to their degree, even to the
ship boy, and then to every servant of the house, nay to the very
kitchin wench who was so churlish unto him, and had so often basted him
instead of her roast meats; having caused her to be called unto him he
gave her an hundred pounds towards her marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>This being done, taylors were sent for, sempsters and the like to put
him into cloaths and linnen of the best, who were to accommodate him
with all speed possible, and his lodging in the garret was chang'd into
the best chamber of the house. And when the barber had been with him and
the rest to make him compleat in his habit, there was a strange and
sudden metamorphosis; for out of a smoky and dirty kitchin-drudge there
appeared a proper and well-proportioned man, and gentile merchant, in so
much that his young mistris began to cast a more amorous eye upon him
than before, which not a little pleased Master Fitzwarren her father,
who intended a match betwixt them.</p>

<p>The brute of this great adventure was presently revised through the
whole city, insomuch that his master intreated his late servant to walk
with him into the Exchange to see the fashion of the merchants, which he
did, when all of them came about him and saluted him, some bid God give
him joy of his fortune, others desired of him better and further
acquaintance, and every one as his several fancy led him: some commended
him for his person, others for his modest answers and discreet carriage.
Indeed, wealth is able to make all these good where they are most
wanting, which was not in him as appears by the sequel.</p>

<p>Within few weeks the match was propounded betwixt Master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> Whittington
and Mistris Alice, and willingly entertained by both parties and not
without great cost, with the invitation of the Lord Mayor and the
Aldermen very nobly celebrated, and the bridegroom by this means had got
acquaintances with the best.</p>

<p>After this his father-in-law demanded of his son what he purposed to
take in hand (his freedom being offered him). Who made answer again that
since God had so blest him in his small adventure he would not leave it
of so, but prove his goodness in a greater, and that his purpose was to
turn merchant, which reply gave him no small content in regard he knew
the best among them would be glad to have the society of so hopeful a
citizen, which he continued adventuring in divers bottoms with his
father, and had very happy and prosperous returns.</p>

<p>The time being come when he was prickt for Sheriff he modestly refused
it as unable to take so great a charge, and would willingly have paid
his fine, which his father-in-law would not suffer, at whose persuasion
he took the place upon him, in which he so well behaved himself in the
management of all affairs belonging to his office that he not only left
it without the least taxation, but with a general love and approbation,
insomuch that the universal eye of the whole city was fixt upon him in
an hopeful expectation what a profitable member of that united body he
might futurely prove, and this hapned in the year of our Lord 1493, Sir
John Hodley grocer being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> mayor and Drewerie Barentine his fellow
Sheriff, of the truth of which Mr. Fabian in his <i>Chronicle</i> and Mr.
John Stow in his <i>Survey of London</i> can fully satisfie you.</p>

<p>In the year 1497 and the one and twentieth of the same Kings reign, Sir
Richard Whittington was Lord Mayor of London, John Woodcok and William
Askam being Sheriffs, and he held the place with great reputation and
honour. In which time of his Mayoralty there was much discontent in the
kingdom, by reason of many differences betwixt the King and the Commons;
the circumstances whereof were here too long to relate, only one thing
is worthy of observation that whether by his adventures or no may it be
questioned, bringing in yearly such store of gold, silks, sattins,
velvets, damasks, stones, and jewels, &amp;c. into the kingdom might be the
cause of that great pride and rioting in apparel which was used in those
days. But as Harding, Fabian, and others have left to me how in that
year of his Mayoralty and after there resorted to the Kings Court at
their pleasures daily, at the least ten thousand persons. In his kitchin
were three hundred servitors, and in every office according to that
rate. Moreover of ladies, chambermaids, and laundresses about three
hundred, and they all exceeded in gorgeous and costly apparel far above
their degrees; for even the yeomen and grooms were clothed in silks and
velvets, damasks, and the like, with imbroydery, rich furs, and
goldsmiths work, devising very strange and new fashions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>And in this year also, about the feast of St. Bartholomew, grew a great
discord betwixt the Duke of Hereford and Mowbery, Duke of Norfolk, the
beginning thereof being as followeth: The two Dukes riding from the
Parliament towards their lodgings, the Duke of Norfolk said to the
other, Sir, you see how variable the King is in his words, and
(reflecting upon what had past) how without mercy he putteth his Lords
and kinsfolks to death, imprisoning some and exciting others. Therefore
it behoveth us not too much to trust to his fair and smooth language,
for doubtless in time he will bring even to us the like death and
destruction. Of which words he accused him to the King, which the other
denying it was to be tryed by combate. The lists were appointed and the
day of meeting the eleventh day of September, to which place and on the
day assigned came both the Dukes and bravely accoutred, appeared before
the King ready to enter into battel; when the King threw down his
warder, and staying the combate banished the Duke of Hereford for ten
years, but the Duke of Norfolk for ever, was travelling many countries,
at the last came to Venice and then ended his life.</p>

<p>Again in 1406, and in the eighth of Henry the fourth, Sir Richard
Whittington was the second time Lord Mayor, Nicholas Worton and Geffery
Brook being Sheriffs. Again in the year 1409, being the seventh year of
Henry the fifth, he supplyed the Pretorship, Robert Whittington (his
near Kins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>man) and John Butler being Sheriffs, and which is more
remarkable of him then of any other that ever preceded him in that place
of honour, he was once Sheriff and three times Lord Mayor of this famous
and honourable City in three several Kings reigns.</p>

<p>Now to cut off all circumstances and come close to the matter, we may
easily find what this man was, by the pious and religious acts done in
his life to the Cities present grace, use and benefit, and to his own
blessed memory for ever.</p>

<p>In the Vintry-ward he built a church and dedicated it to S. Michael
calling it Pater Noster in the Royal, and added to it a Colledge founded
to St. Mary, and placed therein a President and four fellows which ought
to be masters of arts, besides other yearly allowance to clerks and
young schollars, near which he erected an Hospital which he called God's
house, for thirteen poor men, and there according to the devout
superstition of those days were to pray for the souls of his
father-in-law Hugh Fitzwarren and Dame Molde his wife, for whom he
erected a fair tomb in the church he before built, leaving also a place
for himself and Dame Alice his lady when it should please God to call
them. In which place they were afterwards both of them according to
their degree very honourably interred, great mourning and much
lamentation being made for him by the Commons of the City in regard he
was a man so remarkable for his charity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>He builded another brave structure which he called after his own name
Whittington Colledge, with a perpetual allowance for Divinity Lectures
to be read there for ever, leaving good land for the maintenance
thereof.</p>

<p>And on the west side of the City he built that famous gate and prison to
this day called Newgate, and thereupon caused the Merchants arms to be
graven in stone. He added to St. Bartholomew's Hospital in Smithfield
and was at the charge of repairing thereof.</p>

<p>Further at the Grey-Fryars in London he erected a Library as a testimony
of the great love he had to Learning, which he began in the year of our
Lord 1421 and finished it in the year following. Moreover that place
which is called the Stocks to this day, betwixt Cheapside and Cornhill,
a good house of stone, which for a flesh market and a fish market
greatly beneficial to the City.</p>

<p>Besides he enlarged Guild Hall and glazed most or all of the windows at
his own costs or charges, paving the Hall and contributing largely to
the Library, adding to those places a conduit which yieldeth store of
sweet and wholesome water to the general good and benefit of the City.</p>

<p>In the year 1497, when Sir Richard Whittington was first elected Lord
Mayor, that rebel Sir John Oldcastle was taken in the territories of the
Lord Powess, not without danger and hurt of some that took him, at which
time all the States of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> realm were assembled at Parliament in
London, therein to provide the King of a subsidy and other aid of money
and ammunition, who took great pains beyond the seas in France. These
Lords and others when they heard that the publick enemy was taken they
agreed all not to dissolve the Parliament, until he were examined, and
heard to answer in the same. Whereupon the Lord Powess was sent for to
fetch him up with power and great aid, who brought him to London in a
lyter wounded very much having received seventeen wounds and also a
clerk which he called his Secretary with him that was of his counsel in
all his secrecy. As soon as the aforesaid Sir John Oldcastle was brought
into the Parliament before the Earl of Bedford who was then left Regent
and Governour of the Realm in the time of the King's absence being in
France and other Lords and States, his indictment being read before him
of his forcible insurrection against the King and State in St. Gyles's
Fields, and other treasons and outrages by him committed, the question
was asked how he could excuse himself and show why he should not be
judged to dye according to the law. But he seeking other talk and
discourse of the mercies of God, and that all mortal men that would be
followers of God ought to prefer mercy above judgment and that vengeance
pertained only to the Lord, and ought not to be practised by them that
worship, but to be left to God alone, with many other words to pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>tract
the time, until the Lord Chief Justice admonished the Regent not to
suffer him to spend the time so vainly, in molesting the nobles of the
Realm, whereupon the Duke of Bedford, Regent, commanded him to answer
formally and punctually to the matter laid to his charge.</p>

<p>Then said Sir John, being thus urged at last after deliberation taken,
he said, It is the least thing that I account of to be judged by you as
of man's judgment, and again he began to talk, but nothing to the
purpose until the Chief Justice commanded him again to answer finally,
and to answer them if he could, why he should not suffer death according
to his desert. To which he stoutly answered that he had no judge amongst
them, so long as his liege Lord King Richard was alive and in his realm
of Scotland, which answer when he had made, because there needed no
further witness, he was then presently censured to be drawn and hanged
on a gallows and then to be burnt hanging upon the same, which judgment
was executed upon him the thirtieth day of December in St. Gyles's
Fields, where many honourable persons were present, and the last words
that he spake were to Sir Thomas Upingham, adjuring him that if he saw
him rise from death to life again the third day he would procure that
his sect which he had raised might be in peace and quiet. He was hanged
by the neck in a chain of iron and after consumed by fire.</p>

<p>Moreover it is recorded that in the time of this worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> pretor Sir
Richard Whittington the glorious city of Constantinople was taken by
Mahomet the Second, Prince of the Turks, whose souldiers sacked it with
all extremity and omitted no manners of cruelty by violence to either
virgins, aged women, or sucking babes. This Sir Richard Whittington had
traffick from thence by his factors which there abode, and were then
taken prisoners, so that he lost near upon fifteen thousand pounds,
which when he heard of never was so much as cast down or dismayed, but
said God will send more; yea such was the incessant practice of the
Turkish tyranny upon this imperial city, as it exceeded the damage,
rapes and spoyls of other cities. They also beheaded at the same time
Constantine, sticking his head upon a launce, and with derision caused
it to be carried thorow the Turkish camp.</p>

<p>In the space of a week after, there hapned a horrible tempest of thunder
and lightning which burned almost eight hundred houses and spoiled three
thousand people at the sacking of the aforesaid city by the said
Mahomet. The Turks found therein so much treasure that they wondred that
the citizens would not spend it in souldiers for their own defence, but
so dotingly to spare the true spending thereof to become an enticing
prey for their irreconcileable enemies, for indeed it was thought that
if the State would have hired souldiers, and given them good pay they
might have raised the siege of the Turks. It is an old and true saying,
Covetousness is the mother of ruine and mischief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>This strange thing happened in the second time that he was elected Lord
Mayor and that was upon the twenty-seventh of April, being Tuesday in
Easter week: William Foxley, Pot maker for the Mint in the Tower of
London, fell asleep, and so continued sleeping and snoring and could not
be wakened with pricking, cramping, or otherwise burning or whatsoever
till the first day of the term, which was full 14 days and 15 nights.
The cause of this his sleeping could not be known though the same was
diligently searched for by the King's Command of his Physicians and
other learned men, yea the King himself examined the said William
Foxley, who was in all points sound at his awaking to be as if he had
slept but one night, and yet lived 41 years after. But in length of time
did call to mind how he did wish to God that he might sleep a fortnight
together if it was not so and so concerning a bargain between a
neighbour of his and himself.</p>

<p>One Thursday in Whitson week following the Duke of Somerset with Anthony
Rivers and four others kept Justs and Tournament before the King and
Queen and others of the nobility in the Tower of London, against three
Esquires of the Queen's Bedchamber, which were performed before some of
the French nobility that then were Prisoners to the King, which he took
in France, to the great admiration of those strangers who never saw the
like action before, being so earnestly performed. There was also Sir
Richard Whittington and the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Sheriff's, and that night the King and
Queen did sup with the Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>Those strangers which beheld those Justs were prisoners in the Tower at
that time, namely, the Duke of Orleance and Burbon, brother to the Duke
of Britain, the Earls of Vaudosine, of Ewe and Richmond, and the High
Marshal of France, and many other Knights and Esquires to the number of
seven hundred, all which were at one time prisoners to the King, but
nobly used and attended every one according to their rank and quality,
who when they were ransomed made it known to their King how honourably
they were attended in England, and what respect the King and our English
nation shewed them being prisoners who might have taken their lives away
as well as their persons prisoners.</p>

<p>The second thing that was remarkable in Sir Richard Whittington's year
was that the King kept his Christmas at Lambeth, and at the feast of
Purification seven Dolphins of the sea came up to the River of Thames
and played there up and down until four of them were kill'd.</p>

<p>On Saturday the eve of St. Michael the Archangel the year following, in
the morning before day, betwixt the hour of one and two of the Clock,
began a terrible earthquake with Lightning and thunder which continued
the space of six hours, and that universally through the whole world, so
that most men thought the world as then would have ended. The
unreason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>able beasts roared and drew to the town with a hideous noise,
also the fowls of the ayr cryed out, such was the work of God at that
time to call his people to repentance.</p>

<p>The four and twentieth day of January following a battel or combat was
fought in Smithfield within the lists before the King between the men of
Feversham in Kent, John Upton Notary Appelant and John Down Gentleman
defendant. John Upton accused John Down that he and his compiers should
design the King's death on the day of his Coronation following. When
they had fought somewhat long and received each of them some wounds, and
still persisting in their violent action and no hopes to find out the
truth, the King took up the matter and forgave both parties.</p>

<p>On Candlemas eve following in divers places of England was great
weathering of wind, hail, snow, rain with thunder and lightning, whereby
the church of Baldock in Hertfordshire and the church and part of the
town of Walden in Essex, with other neighbouring villages, were sore
shaken, and the steeple of St. Pauls in London about two in the
afternoon was set on fire in the midst of the shaft first on the west
side and then on the south, and divers people espying the fire came to
quench it in the steeple, which they did with vinegar, so far as they
could find, so that when the Lord Mayor with much people came to Pauls
to have holpen if need had been they returned again every man to his own
home, trusting in God all had been well, but anon after between eight
and nine of the clock the fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> burst out again afresh out of the
steeple, by reason of the wind more hot and fervent then before, and did
much hurt to the lead and timber thereof. Then the Lord Mayor and many
people came thither again and with vinegar quenched the fire which was
so violent, but no man received any hurt.</p>

<p>Moreover in Sir Richard Whittington's time lived one Richard Fleming,
Bishop of Lincoln, in the year 1430 who founded Lincoln Colledge in
Oxford, which was afterwards in Richard the third's time in the year of
our Lord 1479 by Thomas Rotherham Bishop of the same sea (<i>sic</i>) much
augmented and enlarged with great revenues. Likewise Magdalen Colledge
in Oxford was built by William Wainfleet Bishop of Winchester, who was a
loving and constant friend to Sir Richard Whittington and did much good
in many parts of this kingdom, and the said Sir Richard did largely
contribute to these and the like pious uses by the intreaty of this
Bishop.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 1419, in which Sir Richard Whittington was the
third time inaugurated into the Mayoralty as is before mentioned King
Henry the fifth, who having conquered the greatest part of France and
espoused Katherine sole daughter to the King and heir to the crown,
taking leave of his father-in-law, embarked with his Royal bride and
landed at Dover upon Candlemas Day, leaving in France for his deputy his
brother the Duke of Clarence, from thence arrived in London the
fourteenth day of February, and the Queen came thither the one and
twentieth day of the same month, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> met upon Black-Heath by the Lord
Mayor and three hundred aldermen and prime citizens in gold chains and
rich costly habits with other sumptuous and brave devices as pageants,
speeches and shows to the great delight and content of both their
Maiesties.</p>

<p>The four and twentieth day of February following being St. Mathew's Day
her coronation was solemnized in St. Peter's Church in Westminster;
which being ended, she was afterwards royally conveyed into the great
hall and there under a rich canopy of State sat to dinner, upon whose
right hand sate at the end of the table the Lord Archbishop's grace of
Canterbury and Henry called the rich Cardinal Bishop of Winchester, upon
the left hand of the Queen sat the King of Scots in a chair of State,
and was served with covered dishes, as the Bishops were. But after them
and upon the same side next to the Boards end were seated the Dutchess
of York and Countess of Huntington, the Earl of March holding a scepter
in his hand, kneeling upon the right side, the Earl Marshal in the like
manner kneeled upon the left hand of the Queen: the Countess of Kent sat
under the table at the right foot, and the Countess Marshal at the left
foot of her Majesty.</p>

<p>Humphery Duke of Glocester was that day overseer and stood before the
Queen bareheaded, Sir Richard Newel was carver and the Earl of Suffolk's
brother cup-bearer, Sir John Stewart, Sewer, the Lord Clifford (instead
of the Earl of Warwick) Pantler, the Lord Willoby (instead of the Earl
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> Arundel) chief Butler, the Lord Gray Caterer, Naperer, the Lord
Audley (in the stead of the Earl of Cambridge) Almner, the Earl of
Worcester was Lord high Marshal, who rode about the Hall on a great
courser, with many tip-staves about him to make room in the Hall. In the
which Hall next after the Queen, the Barons of the Cinque Ports began
the table, upon the right hand towards St. Steven's Capel (<i>sic</i>), and
beneath them at the table sat the Vouchers of the Chancery, and upon the
left hand next to the cupboard sat Sir Richard Whittington (now the
third time Lord Mayor) and his brethren the Aldermen of London. The rest
of the Bishops began the table over against the Baron of the Cinque
Ports, and the ladies and chief noble-women the table against the Lord
Mayor and the Aldermen, at which two tables of the Bishops the Bishop of
London and the Bishop of Durham sat highest at the one and the Countess
of Stafford and the Countess of March on the other. And for ordering of
the service divers chief lords were appointed officers as Steward,
Controuler, Surveyor, and the like, which places were supplyed by the
Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, the Lord Fizmur, the Lord
Farneval, the Lord Gray of Wilton, the Lord Feres of Groby, the Lord
Poynings, the Lord Harrington, the Lord Ducy, the Lord Daker, the Lord
Delaware, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have shewed you onely the ordering of this rich feast, but the cost
and sumptuousness of the fare would ask too long and large a
circumstance to discourse; what I have hitherto done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> was onely to show
to the world that at those high solemnities inaugurations and
coronations the Lord Mayor of the City of London and the Aldermen have
place, and their presence is still required; the City being the King's
Chamber and in an interregnum he the first and prime officer in the
kingdom. But I fear I have dwelt too long on the premises which I hope
none will hold for an unnecessary deviation. I come now to discourse
unto you of Sir Richard Whittington's invitation of the King and Queen
into the City when he bountifully feasted them in his own house at his
own proper charge.</p>

<p>How great and magnificent the Londoners feasts be even amongst
themselves especially at that high and pompous festival at Guild-Hall
the day after Simon and Jude, at the solemn inauguration of his Lordship
who but knows, as also the ordinary Tables of the Lord Mayor and the
Sheriffs where there is free and generous entertainment for all men of
fashion and quality, the like both for plenty of dishes and order of
service is not elsewhere to be or found through Europe. If then their
daily provision be so curious and costly, what may we think their
variety and rarity was at the invitation and entertainment of two such
great majesties? I must therefore leave it to the Readers imagination
being so far transcending my expression. Let it therefore give
satisfaction to any one that shall doubt thereof, that it was performed
to the everlasting reputation of the honour of the city and great
content of these royal personages invited. The bounty of the table not
to be question'd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> I come now to the fire that he made in the Presence
chamber where the King and Queen then dined, which was only of sweet and
odoriferious (<i>sic</i>) wood, far exceeding the smell of juniper, for it
was mixed with mace, cinnamon, and other rare and costly spices, which
did cast such a pleasant and delightful savor through the room that it
pleased his majesty to call him unto him and say, my good Lord Mayor,
though your fare be choice, costly and abundant, yet above all things I
have observed in your noble entertainment this fire which you have
provided for me gives me more content. To whom Sir Richard Whittington
making a low obeysance made answer, It much rejoyceth me dread Soveraign
that any that remaineth in my power can give your highness the least
cause to be pleased, but since you praise this fire already made I
purpose ere your sacred majesty depart the house to entertain you with
one (I hope) that shall content you much better. The King not thinking
it could be possible desired him to make a proof thereof, when he
(having before provided himself for that purpose) brought a great bundle
of Bonds, Indentures and Covenants under his arm, said thus to the King,
Royal Soveraign to whom I owe both my fortunes and my life, I have here
a faggot of purpose left for this fire, which I hope will smell much
more sweetly than the first in your nostrils, for saith he, here is
first your Highness security for ten thousand marks, lent you for the
maintainance of your royal wars in France, by the Right Worshipful
Company of the Mercers, which I here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> cancel and cast into the fire,
fifteen hundred lent by the City to our Majesty I send after the former,
two thousand marks borrowed of the Grocers Company, three thousand of
the Merchant Taylors, one thousand of the Drapers, one thousand of the
Skinners, one thousand of the Ironmongers, one thousand of the Merchant
Staplers, of the Goldsmiths three thousand, of the Haberdashers as much,
of the Vintners, Brewers and Brown Bakers three thousand marks. All
these you see are cancel'd and burnt, saith he, with divers other bonds
for money lent by my father in law Aldermen Fitzwarren for the payment
of your souldiers in France, which coming unto me by executorship I have
taken in and discharged.</p>

<p>Others there likewise due to me of no small sums by divers of your
nobility here present, all which with the former I have sacrificed to
the love and honour of my dread sovereign, amounting to the sum of three
score thousand pounds sterling, and can your Majesty (saith he) desire
to sit by a fire of more sweet scent and savour? At this the King was
much extasi'd and the rather because it came unexpectedly and from so
free a spirit, and embracing him in his arms said unto him that he
thought never King had such a subject, and at his departure did him all
the grace and honour that could descend from a King to a subject,
promising him moreover that he should ever stand in the first rank of
those whom he favoured. And so the Lord Mayor bearing the sword before
their two most sacred Majesties as far as Temple Bar the King for his
former service and his most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> kind and loving entertainment at that time,
and the noble men for that extraordinary courtesie offered them all
unitely (<i>sic</i>) and unanimously commended his goodness, applauded his
bounty and wished that he might live to perpetual memory and so bid both
him and the City for that time adieu.</p>

<p>To omit all other circumstances having acquainted you with the poor and
mean estate of this Sir Richard Whittington when he came first into the
City of London, and by what means he was relieved in his miserable
poverty, as also the fortunate success of his small adventure whereby he
was raised unto so great honour, that he became the Cities Governour,
and how discreetly and wisely he behaved in his authority and office,
gaining thereby the love and probation (<i>sic</i>) of all men. And further
having shewed you what goodly buildings have been raised by his great
cost and charge, as one church, two colledges, and certain almshouses,
with yearly means left for the maintenance of all such as shall be
admitted into them, and many other charitable acts performed by him
which are before related, to the great good and benefit of the City, and
what things of note happened in his time, I will now conclude with
Master Stow, O that London had a Park near adjoining to it, stored with
such Deer (as doubtless it hath, though not easily known) for some build
Alms houses, free schools, causies and Bridges in needful and necessary
places, others repair ruinated and decayed churches, relieving Hospitals
in a bountiful manner, and are weekly benefactors to Prisons and those
performed by such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> agents faithfully, that the true bestowers are not
publicly noted, howsoever they may be easily supposed. But the glory
they seek to invade here will (no doubt) for ever shine on them
elsewhere. And that great God who hath created us, and plentifully
distributed in his great bounty all things to men, and yet not given all
things to any one man, lest it might take away that necessary commerce
and mutual society which ought to be amongst us, stir up the minds of
more of them to imitate at least, though not to exceed them in their
bounty and liberality.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
